This is a ContentBox module to automatically and asynchronously ping blog aggregators after you post new entries.  After activating the module, there will be a new menu item called Modules > Blog Ping.  On that page, supply a list of ping URLs on separate lines.  An HTTP GET will be run against each of them in order any time a blog post is saved.  Drop the contents of the repo into a folder in your modules directory, or better yet-- install it via ForgeBox in the ContentBox admin.
